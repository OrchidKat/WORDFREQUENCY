# WORDFREQUENCY
In this Report, we aim to enhance the Word Frequency Counting solution by developing a hybrid data structure consisting of a hash table, a binary search tree, and a Trie. This hybrid data structure offers an efficient and versatile approach to counting the frequency of words in a given text or paragraph. By incorporating multiple data structures, we can leverage their respective strengths and overcome limitations, providing a more comprehensive and powerful solution.

The hybrid data structure combines the fast lookup and insertion capabilities of the hash table, the sorted ordering and efficient searching of the binary search tree, and the prefix matching capabilities of the Trie. By utilizing this combination, we can efficiently handle a wide range of word frequency counting scenarios, including searching for individual words, finding words with specific prefixes, and determining the total occurrence of each word.

This project aims to explore the advantages and motivations behind using a hybrid data structure for word frequency counting. We will delve into the implementation details, discussing the integration and interplay of the constituent data structures within the hybrid data structure. We will also examine any design choices and trade-offs made during the implementation phase to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and functionality.

Furthermore, we will identify and describe practical applications where this hybrid data structure can be effectively utilized. We will discuss how the combination of the hash table, binary search tree, and Trie enables efficient operations for these applications, such as text analysis, natural language processing, and information retrieval systems.

To evaluate the performance of the hybrid data structure, we will analyze the time complexity of key operations supported by the data structure, including word insertion, lookup, and prefix matching. We will also analyze the space complexity, considering memory utilization and overhead. To assess the efficiency of the hybrid data structure, we will compare its performance with that of individual constituent data structures, showcasing the benefits of the hybrid approach.

Experimental evaluation will be conducted using appropriate datasets and methodologies. We will present the experimental setup, including the selection of datasets and any specific considerations for the experiments. The results obtained from the experiments, including performance metrics and efficiency improvements, will be presented and interpreted, highlighting the advantages of the hybrid data structure.

Finally, we will discuss the practicality and effectiveness of the implemented hybrid data structure in real-world scenarios. We will reflect on the limitations, challenges, and potential future improvements for the hybrid data structure. The findings and outcomes of the project will be summarized, emphasizing the practical applications, performance analysis, and efficiency of the hybrid data structure. The overall success of the project and insights gained from its implementation and evaluation will be discussed.

By developing and analyzing this hybrid data structure for word frequency counting, we aim to provide a robust and efficient solution that can be applied to various text processing tasks, improving the accuracy and speed of word frequency analysis in real-world scenarios.
